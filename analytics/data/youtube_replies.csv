-z6q,"I used to rule the worldSeas would rise when I gave the wordNow in the morning, I sleep aloneSweep the streets I used to ownI used to roll the diceFeel the fear in my enemy's eyesListen as the crowd would singNow the old king is dead! Long live the king!One minute I held the keyNext the walls were closed on meAnd I discovered that my castles standUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sandI hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explainOnce you go there was never, never a honest wordAnd that was when I ruled the worldIt was a wicked and wild windBlew down the doors to let me inShattered windows and the sound of drumsPeople couldn't believe what I'd becomeRevolutionaries waitFor my head on a silver plateJust a puppet on a lonely stringOh, who would ever want to be king?I hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Calvary choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the worldOh, oh, oh, oh, ohI hear Jerusalem bells are ringingRoman Calvary choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign fieldFor some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the world"
